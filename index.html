                        William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and
                        actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest
                        dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works,
                        including collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative
                        poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into
                        every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
                        <br> <br>

                        Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he
                        married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith.
                        Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and
                        part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's
                        Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years
                        later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable
                        speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs,
                        and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are often
                        criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the
                        period.<br> <br>

                        Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were
                        primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these
                        genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and
                        Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language. In the last phase
                        of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other
                        playwrights.<br> <br>

                        Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his
                        lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and
                        Henry Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected
                        edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was
                        prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a
                        now-famous quote as "not of an age, but for all time".<br> <br>

                        Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually adapted and
                        rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are
                        studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various cultural and political contexts around the
                        world.<br> <br>
